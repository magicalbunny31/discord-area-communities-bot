                  - everything has changed! from start prices to decrease/increase intervals
                  - this is to introduce an element of "luck" when deciding to buy/sell carrots
                  - of course, if you're observant enough, you may notice some small differences between decrease/increase intervals: but you have to be on top of your game to figure them out~
