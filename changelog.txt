### NOT READING ALLAT ü§¶ü§£

### jesus christ bunny this took a while
> - 397 files created/changed/removed, ~2 months and a whole heck of hot chocolate consumed~

### future plans
> - next, commands that are to be implemented will be added:
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency events:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency leaderboard:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency trade:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </levels leaderboard:1132730748370174045>
> - then i'll probably focus on bug fixes as a lot of major commands were added - they all have very intricate parts!

> - fixed users being ordered incorrectly
>  - this was because of a member somehow having `null` experience, which somehow threw the whole thing off
> - fixed the command sometimes being referred to as "**/leaderboard**"

### schedules
> - fixed missing catch statement in the schedules' error handler
>  - without it, it would've caused this error handler to throw an error (..think about it: an error in an error? that's not good at all)
