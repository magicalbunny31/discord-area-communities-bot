### NOT READING ALLAT ü§¶ü§£
> - shut the fuck up

### jesus christ bunny this took a while
> - 397 files created/changed/removed, ~2 months and a whole heck of hot chocolate consumed~

### future plans
> - next, commands that are to be implemented will be added:
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency events:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency leaderboard:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </currency trade:1116857516324827148>
>  - <:flooded_area:995461994989756526> </levels leaderboard:1132730748370174045>
> - then i'll probably focus on bug fixes as a lot of major commands were added - they all have very intricate parts!

> - i've decided to make this command accessible for all who share servers with <@983126054619189370> so that modmail could be submitted when you're banned (though they're NOT for ban appeals, those are managed by <@155149108183695360>> through [this form](https://dyno.gg/form/646fbb52))
> - ..also, since this is the bot's first ever global command, it's got a whole new <:activedev:1042545590640324608> badge!
